    <p>At <strong>Up’a’step</strong>, we believe that there is power in collaboration especially when people have understood the true essence of collaboration. When people have learned to lift each other up as they perfect their own craft, in the process, they magically create a mark in their pathway. We want you to believe in your own purpose, to build your own legacy and take every possible step in making that a reality.</p>
    <p>Have you ever read a book for inspiration only to realise you probably can’t relate with most of the advice?<br>Up’a’step is here to offer an additional source of inspiration, one that you can closely relate with. We will be sharing stories of students who will share tips and advice based on their learnings in their respective journeys, many of which will be similar to the challenges & successes you also encounter. “If others can do it, so can you!”</p>
    <p>At Up’a’step, we don’t believe in waiting for you to become famous for us to celebrate your success and the impact it’s bringing to your community. Many college students are challenging the status quo day in day out so we want to celebrate them NOW! as we share their journey every step of the way. We believe that in celebrating these individuals their stories will illuminate the path for many other students to go up a step!</p>
